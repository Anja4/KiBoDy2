Info you need to play the game:

The object of the game is to protect the master tree (in the center). If this tree is destroyed, you lose.
Use WASD to move your character. Click to shoot. Press E to place a tree (given that you have the money required). 
Press Q To switch what type of tree you want to plant. A new tree will be given to you every here and there.
Touching a tree will replenish it's ammunition.

Trees:

Manufactured
	These are the basic trees. Shoot stuff.

Oak
	These are stronger than normal, but can be easily caught off guard due to it's
	long recharge.
Petrified
	Does no damage, but has a lot of health. Meant to be a wall, and block enemies.
Bamboo
	Does no damage, but heals trees around it.
Shrub
	Initially does no damage, but as it gets hurt, it builds up rage.
	When you replenish it's ammo, it will compile all of it's rage into one shot.
	Afterward, resetting it's rage to 0.

Enemies:

Spider
	Basic enemy. Kill em'.
Swarm
	Small and fast, but have low health. ZURG RUSH!!!
Tank
	Large, and dangerous, but moves slowly.
Ranged
	Can hurt trees from a distance.
